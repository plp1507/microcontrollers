Assorted microcontroller codes - by Pedro Lucca Pereira

####################################################

The code featured in this repository has been developed throughout projects
I've participated while in college. They're mainly used for the ESP32/ESP8266
or the Arduino Uno for projects featured in Control Engineering and Instrumentation
classes, as well as a scientific research in Biomedical Engineering I've participated
in 2024.

They involve digital signal processing techniques, the use of different sensors, wireless
communications and the implementation of digital controllers.
